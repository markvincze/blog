# Motivation

After working for the same employer for 10 years, and not regulalry updating my resume, I will be looking for a new job starting with 2026, thus I started looking into updating my CV.
My previous resume was created with Microsoft Word, and saved as a PDF to be able to share it with recruiters or add as an attachment when applying to positions. But since I'm not using the Office suite any more, I could not even properly open the original editable version, which I found somewhere saved as a docx file.
I considered using the same approach now as well, just switch from Microsoft Word to Google Doc. But the thought of this did not fill me with joy, I remembered that crafting a document with a fine-tuned layout in Word was a cumbersome experience, and I'd rather use an approach with which I could utilize—or potentially showcase—my skills relevant to my profession.
Thus I decided to create my new CV with HTML and CSS.

# Goals

When I set out to create my new resume with HTML, I had the following goals:

 - Create a layout which works well on both desktop and mobile screens, using responsive design.
 - Publish the resume together with my website containing my blog.
 - Even though I find a CV available as a web page more convenient than a PDF file, I know that the reality is that a PDF version of the resume is still a must-have to be able to upload as an attachment when applying to position, or sending to a recruiter in an email. Due to this it was important to make it possible to easily export the HTML resume to a PDF.

Implementing my CV with HTML also brings the following benefits:
 - Being able to maintain it in source control, together with the contents of my website.
 - Using the link to the resume will always open its latest version, which helps avoiding outdated version of the PDFs circulating.
 - Potentially being able to use analytics to see how often my CV is opened.
