# Motivation

After working for the same employer for 10 years, and not regulalry updating my resume, I will be looking for a new job starting with 2026, thus I started looking into updating my CV.
My previous resume was created with Microsoft Word, and saved as a PDF to be able to share it with recruiters or add as an attachment when applying to positions. But since I'm not using the Office suite any more, I could not even properly open the original editable version
