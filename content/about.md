I'm a software developer specialized in C# and modern C++, with extensive experience in using the Microsoft technology stack. I try to blog about things I find interesting during work or hobby projects.
I'm currently working at [Travix](http://www.travix.com) in Amsterdam.

I worked with the following technologies.

- C#: 6 years of experience, client and server side.
- C++: 3 years of developing modern, cross-platform code.
- XAML: Several projects for various platforms.
- ASP.NET: Used Web Forms, MVC and Web API.
- Other: WPF, Windows Phone, Azure, WinRT, WCF, JNI, TypeScript, MS SQL, Entity Framework, MS Mediaroom.

I occasionally [tweet](https://twitter.com/mrkvincze), and you can find me on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/974733/mark-vincze) as well.
