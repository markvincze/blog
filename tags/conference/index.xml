      <description>In the beginning of June I was lucky enough to be able to travel to the NDC conference in Oslo. (Hats off to my employer Travix for providing the budget!)
The NDC has always been one of my favourite conferences besides Build and CppCon (and earlier the PDC and MIX), but so far I have only been following it online by watching the sessions uploaded to Vimeo. This was the first year I had the chance to actually travel to the conference, and it was a splendid experience.</description>
